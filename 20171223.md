## EasyHook

The reinvention of Windows API Hooking

### Welcome to EasyHook

EasyHook makes it possible to extend(via hooking)unmanaged code APIS with pure managed functions,

from within a fully managed environment on 32- or 64-bit Windows XP SP2, Windows Vista x64, Windows Server 2008 x64,

Windows 7, Windows8.1, and Windows 10.

EasyHook supports injecting assemblies built for .NET Framework 3.5 / 4.0+ as well as native DLLs.

### Features

- A "Thread Deadlock Barrier" deals with many core problems when hooking unknown APIs;

This technology is unique to EasyHook

- You can write managed hook handlers for unmanaged APIs

- You can use all the convenience managed code provides, like .NET Remoting, WPF, and WCF

- .NET assemblies are injected into a new AppDomain where possible, ensuring that your assemblies are 

completely unloaded from the target when detached.

- You can write injection libraries and host processes compiled for AnyCPU, which allows you to 

inject your assembly into both 32- and 64-bint processes from 64- and 32-bit processes.

- Your .NET assemblies do not need to be registered in the Global Assembly Cache(GAC) - greatly simplifying

development and releases

- EasyHook supports RIP-relative address relocation for 64-bit targets.

- Support for hooking Com interfaces.

- A documented pure unmanaged hooking API

- No resource or memory leaks are left in the target.

- EasyHook32.dll and EasyHook64.dll are native libraries that can be used without any .NET framework installed.

- All hooks are installed and automatically removed in a stable manner.

- Support for Thread ACLs to control which threads will use the hook.

- Experimental stealth injection mechanism that won't raise attention of AV Software.

- Managed/Unmanaged module stack trace inside a hook handler.

- Get calling Managed/Unmanged module inside a hook handler.

- Create custom stack traces inside a hook handler.

- No unpacking/installation necessary.

- The Visual Studio redistributable are not required.

- Support for 32- and 64-bit kernel mode hooking - however no support for bypassing PatchGuard is supplied.
