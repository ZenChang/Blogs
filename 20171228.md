# Codeing Style Conventions

Coding style conventions are used in this series to aid clarity and consistency.

The "Hungarian" notation conventions are used.

These have become a common coding practice in win32 programming.

They include variable prefix notaion that give to variable names a suggestion of the type of the variable.

The following table lists common prefixes.
